## Summary:
Knowledge Rocket is for teachers who wish to provide automated knowledge reminders for their students.

Students are registered by teachers and do not need or use accounts of their own.

Knowledge rockets are short paragraphs followed by a multiple choice question. These are automatically sent two days, two weeks, and two months after a lesson is taught and are intended to cause the student to recall what they have learned. The rockets should not be used to provide an exhaustive review. Instead, they ask the student to "reload" the mental maps the acquired during the lesson.

## Running Front End:

From root folder on your command prompt of choice ( We used git bash ) type `cd frontend`: then in there you will have to run `yarn install` or `npm install` ( your preference ), to install all frontend dependencies. After that is complete, you can proceed to `npm start`, or `yarn start`. This should locally host the frontend.

## Running Back End

From root folder on your command prompt of choice ( We used git bash ), type `pipenv install`, then after the dependencies have been installed you can proceed to then type `pipenv shell`. You have now created a virtualEnv for the backend, now you can type, `python ./manage.py makemigrations`. If it says "No changes detected", you will still want to migrate, considering you cloned a local project, you still need to fill the DB with Django tables for it to organize the data. So after you made migrations, type `python ./manage.py migrate`, you will notice, it migrates the DB!

You are almost complete, after you have successfully migrated the server, you will then type `python ./manage.py runserver`. Viola, you have now locally hosted the backend!

## Instructions

	Step 1
		Create User/Login

	Step 2
		Navigate to create class page (selecting new class from post-login splash screen).
		create a new class (class name must be unique).

		add at least 1 student via add student section of create class page.
		
	Step 3 
		Navigate to create rocket page (selecting new rocket from bottom of create class page).

		Follow the onscreen instructions; select your newly created class then proceed to fill out available fields.

		The answer fields are multiple choice answer pertaining to the previous question.

		Each question has 1 correct answer that you select by clicking the corresponding radio buttons.

		After you have completed the form click submit and you will be redirected to the rocket page that lists all the rockets according to the selected class.

	Step 4
		Navigate to the build and send email section of the application. (Linked in the Email portion of the Navigation bar).

		Use the drop downs to select a class first; then select the rocket second.

		Once a valid class and rocket have been selected click the button that corresponds to the interval you wish to send.

		Each interval corresponds the rocket fields you filled out in the create rocket page.

		Once you have selected the interval that portion of your rocket will be previewed at the bottom of the page.

		Enter an email title and short message to your students.

		If that data is correct click the build and send email button; this will build an email with a the submitted title and message as well as a URL that corresponds to the interval and portion of the rocket that you selected.

		The email will then be sent to every student in the selected class.
	
	Step 5
		Once your students receive your email the email will inherit the title and message you submitted; as well as a hyperlink student can use to display the quiz.

		By navigating to the hyperlink a quiz will load; students then read the review text and question; submit their answer and an alert will pop up indicating the correct answer.

**Note due to time constraints and issues the delayed sending functionality was not completed, emails do however send immediately toall class students**
